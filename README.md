# Web-Testing
This project (built with Gradle) is a group of web tests using Selenide, Webdriver and TestNG as the testing framework. Allure is used for creating run reports. Tests can be ran either locally or remotely (in a Docker container).

In this project I used the Page Object design pattern, where each page has a seperate class which lists all elements, methods and checks related to that page.

## Run
Java and Gradle need to be installed. Command to build and execute all tests:
```bash
gradle clean test downloadAllure allureServe
```
This will automatically set up the browser (Chrome by WebDriverManager), run all tests in 2 parallel processes, and will present an Allure report with the results.

The report contains data on each test, parameters which were used for it, and execution history. At the end of each test there are also attachments of a screenshot and HTML code of the web page.

## [Download Video Recordings and Logs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1raaonersGmFzjeADcowghLetQ_9sdp8k)
Zalenium container was used to record the videos and logs of test executions. You can download them in a separate zip file.

## Changing Launch Parameters
By default the tests and launched locally in Chrome. By editing **application.properties** in root project directory you can change the following parameters:

* **remote** = true (Launch remotely in Zalenium) / false (Launch in browser locally)
* **selenoidUrl** = (If previous is set to "true", specify the Zalenium URL here)
* **headless** = true (If remote=false, launch browser locally in headless mode) / false (Launch browser regularly)

## Website Info
For testing I chose 2 different websites. Tests access local mirrors of these websites downloaded to the project directory.

<summary>TheInternet</summary>
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

This website consists of separate pages with various web elements designed for running simple tests (e.g. working with logins, drop-down lists, downloading files). It’s useful for demonstrating basic manipulations with content.

Selenium Easy is a website with various automation tutorials. It has a seperate section with diffrent widgets (calendar, intervactive tables, pop-up messages and JavaScript windows) for practicing selenium tests. Provides a nice addition to the previous site for testing various scenarios.
